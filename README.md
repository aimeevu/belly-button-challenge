## GA Tech Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp Module 14
### Description

<p>For this module, we work with Javascript in order to build a dashboard to present an overall visual on a dataset that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.</p>

<p>By using the dropdown menu, the charts will change based off of the data for a particular test subject. First, there is a table that will retrieve the metadata and provide the demographic info for the test subject.</p>

<p>Next, the vertical bar chart displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for an individual.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a bubble chart that displays each sample for the test subject.</p>
